# Nurse Salaries Project

This research project aims to analyze the salaries of nurses in different countries before and after the pandemic. It aims to create an analytics tool to processes various datasets, generates reports, and visualizes the data trends to help HR teams make data-driven decisions about healthcare employment.

## Introduction

This research examines nurses' salaries in Ireland compared to those in various countries, including Australia, Canada, the USA, and several European nations. The study factors in GDP, cost of living, exchange rates, and other variables to understand salary differences. In 2022, Ireland's average nurse salary was $64,000, ranking third among the countries studied. The paper also explores the evolving role of nurses in healthcare and highlights disparities in compensation despite their crucial role in patient care. The aim is to provide insights for nurses to make informed career decisions. The project follows the Waterfall model for structured project management and uses the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework for data analysis, with Jupyter Local chosen as the development environment.


## Usage

**Audience and Technology:** This project is public. This project is intended for the use of the developers and academic purposes for the program.

It is expected that the user is familiarized with Python programing, executing and debugging Data Analytics tasks, like data cleaning, data wrangling and statistical description of the data. Libraries used include Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Plot.ly, Seaborn, among others.

In order to check the notebooks, the following recommended procedure is advised:

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

### Option 1. Run the Notebooks on Google Colab (Recommended for Easy Access)

To run the notebooks on Google Colab (no setup required locally), follow these steps:

- Go to Google Colab.
- Click on File > Open notebook.
- Select the GitHub tab, and paste the URL of this repository into the search bar.
- Select the notebook you want to explore.

Now you can run the notebooks on Colab, interact with the datasets, and modify the code as needed.

### Option 2: Download the files and explore them in your machine

#### 1. Clone the Repository in your local machine

If you do not want to use Colab, you can use your won installation of Jupyter Notebooks, and download all the files in your preferred location.

To get started, you first need to download the project from GitHub. Open your terminal or Git Bash and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
```

This will download the entire repository to your local machine.

### 2. Set Up Your Local Environment (Optional)

If you prefer to work locally, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your machine. If not, you can install it using:

```
pip install notebook
```

After installation, navigate to the project folder and run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser, where you can select and run the notebooks.

### 3. Interact with the Datasets and Code

Once the notebook is open, you can start executing the cells to explore the datasets and the statistical techniques used. You can also modify the code to experiment with different approaches or datasets. Colab provides a powerful environment with GPU support, so you can run computationally intensive tasks directly in the cloud.
